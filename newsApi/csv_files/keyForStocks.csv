(Photo by JENS SCHLUETER / AFP) (Photo by JENS SCHLUETER/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images There is a glut of some semiconductors, so investors are selling the stocks of all chip companies. The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday ran a feature about semiconductors, soaring inventories, and weak demand. Investors then sold chip stocks across the board. Easy narratives drive stock prices, regardless of facts. It’s a lesson, and an opportunity for investors. Let’s be clear, some semiconductor markets are in a glut. We know this because executives from the companies that are the biggest players in those markets have told us. Sanjay Mehrotra, chief executive at Micron Technology MU (MU) says that computer memory inventory at the Lehi, Utah-based company is well above internal targets. That’s code for too much stock, and forced price cuts. In the interim, Micron is also cutting 10% of its workforce to smooth out the short term hit to profitability. Then there is Intel INTC Corp. (INTC) , the world’s largest maker of central processing units, the brains of most PCs and data center servers. Intel has been a bad business for so long it is hard to remember when executives were on the right side of industry trends. Forbes reports that nothing has changed.

The companies supply Hewlett Packard (HPQ) , Dell Technologies DELL (DELL) and the rest of the industry that is not Apple AAPL (AAPL) . Business has been bad since late 2021 when businesses and consumers stopped upgrading their computers to get online. And there lies the larger problem for investors in chip businesses. The upgrade cycle coming out of the pandemic was real, yet short-lived. The lockdown forced companies to upgrade laptops, and enterprise software suites. A lot of those sales were pulled forward, out of the normal capital expenditure cycle. Sales that would have occurred in 2022 became redundant. Add a slowing global economy, due to higher interest rates, layoffs and general worry and you get weaker consumer demand, too. These factors are causing a glut of chips, for PCs, smartphones, and other categories impacted by the pandemic pull forward. That is a substantial part of the semiconductor business, however, it is not all of the sector. The world is not really awash in chips. There are too many of the chips that have become commoditized over time. Some parts of the sector, like specialized graphics processing units for cutting edge datacenters, next generation silicon for electric vehicles, power stations and EV charging infrastructure are experiencing high demand. Companies like On Semiconductor (ON) have sold out production years in advance. And the Journal notes that executives at Lattice Semiconductor LSCC (LSCC) , a supplier to the defense industry and data centers, are not concerned with rising inventories given the nature of its customers. Despite this, both On Semiconductor and Lattice were hit hard Tuesday in the fallout from the WSJ semiconductor story. The stocks declined 1.7%, and 3.5% respectively. And that is the lesson for investors: Big narratives drive stock prices, even when the storyline is fundamentally flawed. Smart investors wait for the fallout, look for support levels, then invest wisely. There is one other factor for semiconductor investors to keep in mind. The stock prices typically begin moving higher as executives guide analysts’ expectations about future inventories. Colette Kress, chief financial offer at Nvidia told analysts in November that inventory levels could normalize by the end of January. Nvidia shares responded by rising from $139 to $187.70 during the next six weeks, a gain of 35%. Overall, semiconductor sales are projected to reach $1 trillion by 2030, according to a research reports from Gartner IT , and McKinsey . The only weak spot was PCs. Researchers at Gartner expect a modest 5.4% decline for PC sales in 2023. The bottom line is that the current narrative about the semiconductor glut is an opportunity. Investors should look for attractive entry levels for their favorite businesses in the sector. The sector is not a monolith, and it is not in decline. I’m keeping On Semiconductor on my radar.

I cover the intersection of economics, politics and personal finance. Following Aug 24, 2023, 05:24pm EDT | Press play to listen to this article! Got it! Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Meter read high level of national debt result. Color scale with arrow from blue to red. The ... [+] measuring device icon. Colorful infographic gauge element. National flag of USA getty The federal government, initially established to serve the people, has veered off course. While Americans are going about their business, it is business as usual in Washington. In short, the politicians who were elected to represent us are seemingly more interested in pandering to special interest groups and their own political party. Meanwhile, the national debt continues to rise with no sign of abating. Thus, the country is on a collision course with financial reality. How long until the American dream becomes the American nightmare? How long will Americans tolerate the reckless spending, which permeates Washington? Surplus-Deficit When you spend more than you collect, you have a deficit and must borrow to meet expenses. The last time the federal government had a budget surplus was 1998-2001 when President Clinton occupied the White House and republicans controlled both sides of Congress. In recent years the deficits have exploded and the national debt, which now stands at more than $32 trillion, continues to soar. If America were a business, it would have filed for bankruptcy long ago. The following chart reveals the federal government’s fiscal year surplus/deficit from 1901 to 2023. Note how the end of the gold standard marked the beginning of recurring deficits. Without a gold standard, there is no need to back each dollar with gold and the government can essentially print as much currency as it desires. As noted in the chart, the worst deficit was over $3.13 trillion at the beginning of COVID, and the most recent deficit was over $1.37 trillion as of fiscal year ending 9-30-2022. Remember, when there is a deficit, the government must borrow to meet expenses, which increases the national debt. Federal government budget surplus-deficit from 1901 to 2023 MJ Patton The National Debt The national debt is fast approaching $33 trillion and is projected to exceed $44 trillion by 2027, only four short years from now. Despite this, Congress continues to spend excessively, while each party blames the other. How long can America continue its present course? This depends on the government’s ability to meet its financial obligations along with the willingness of Congress to curtail spending. What could happen when things implode? This is a scenario where civil unrest could escalate and crime flourish. In essence, if the financial fabric of America is badly shaken, society as we know it could experience a radical change. We already have civil unrest from many at the lower end of the social-economic ladder. Will Congress reduce spending before it’s too late? It seems unlikely as doing so could alienate millions of voters. You see, politicians have been redistributing tax dollars and borrowed monies for years to garner support. Once elected, the goal is to get reelected. While many programs are necessary, there is a massive amount of wasteful spending which desperately needs to be addressed. While millions of Americans are suffering, Washington spends billions of dollars unnecessarily. Shouldn’t we use some of this money to improve the lives of U.S. citizens?

The chart below shows the level of the national debt from 1966 to the present. Notice the sharp increase after 2008 and an even sharper increase beginning in 2020. Again, our trillion-dollar deficits are simply added to the debt. Federal government debt from 1966 to 2023 MJ Patton The Bank of International Settlements (BIS), the bank of 63 central banks (including the U.S. Fed), in a 2011 research paper has concluded when a government’s debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 85%, economic activity is slowed. The U.S. ratio is now close to 120%. Rahm Emanuel, current Ambassador to Japan, former member of Congress (2003-2009), Chief of Staff under President Obama (2009-2010), and mayor of Chicago (2011-2019), once said, “You never let a crisis go to waste. And what I mean by that, it's an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before.” In other words, politicians should seize the opportunity to increase government spending during a crisis. Unfortunately for taxpayers, when the federal government expands, even after the crisis ends, it rarely returns to its pre-crisis size. Will politicians begin acting responsibly with the finances of the United States? There have been a few members of Congress who seem to get it, but they’ve been drowned out by the majority who prefer the status quo. Excessive and wasteful spending continues, enormous deficits remain, and the debt is poised to rise even further. Term limits might solve the problem, but asking members of Congress to vote to limit their time in Washington is a bit like asking the fox to guard the henhouse. Neither are practical.
